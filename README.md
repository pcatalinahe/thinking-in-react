How is state and props working in this app?

State dynamically updates the app on user input. FilterableProductTable uses filterText and inStockOnly to update UI based on the entry on search bar, and/or if the checkbox is checked or not. Props pass data between components. FilterableProductTable sends filterText, inStockOnly, and products as props to ProductTable which allows for filtering and proper display of products.
